# Sea Glass

This code drive a string of four [Adafruit Neopixel](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168) LEDs connected
to an [AdaFruit 5V Trinket](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1501) causing the four LEDs to glow white with
varying brightness that emulates the rhythm of human breathing.

It's use to power four LEDs hidden inside a collection of sea glass
found on a beach inside an old glass jar. It makes a simple night light.
